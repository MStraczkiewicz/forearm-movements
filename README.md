# Upper limb movements as digital biomarkers in people with ALS.

## Purpose

In our approach, we estimate the upper limb movements by measuring the gravitational component of the tri-axial raw accelerometer data collected from a wrist.
Movements are quantified in terms of counts and durations of upper limb flexion, extension, supination, and pronation. 

New measures were compared against ALSFRS-RSE total score (Q1–12), and individual responses to specific questions related to handwriting (Q4), cutting food (Q5),
dressing and performing hygiene (Q6), and turning in bed and adjusting bed clothes (Q7). Additional analysis considered adjusting for total activity counts (TAC).

## Validation

The proposed metrics were validated clinically using data from twenty ALS patients observed for six months in free-living conditions. Analytical validation was carried out using independent data collected from ten ALS patients observed in controlled conditions.
